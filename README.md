# GIPHY Project

This website is a responsive front-end project that uses the GIPHY API to populate the site
with GIFs.
Specifically, it uses the axios AJAX method to perform AJAX GET requests to the query URL to get
data from the GIPHY API.
After the query URL is constructed, the URL is used to perform the request.
The site then uses the React library of Javascript to dynamically populate the page with the GIFs.
